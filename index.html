    <div id="About Me">
      <p>Hi, I am Colin Maguire, a programmer, specializing in Game Development, from London, Ontario,
        who loves to code.</p>

      <p>I recently graduated from Fanshawe College in 2020, where I obtained a graduate certificate for Software and Information Systems Testing. Before that,
        I graduated from Niagara College in 2017, where I obtained an advanced diploma in Game Development. Learning
        everything about game development from the 3D modelling to game documents. But mostly focused on the
        programming side of things, where I learned how to do AI, networking and game mechanics,
        just to name a few of the topics that were taught.</p>

        <p>If you would like a copy of my resume,
          please feel free to email me using the link in the header, thanks.</p>

<p>Fanshawe College</p>
<p>3.7 GPA</p>
<p>In this program I learned design, run and review tests on software and information systems. Throughout the program I was tought how to make documents like a Test Strategy, Test Cases, Test Scripts and many more. Well also learning how to run these tests, with the test types being, but not limited; Automatied, Capacity, Load and Functional testing. And I took all this lessons, and incorrperated it in a group setting with the capstone project, which I and 6 others in my group, had to create all the test documents and run the tests for a website developed for this course. We then had to submit a report to the teacher at the end, documenting all of our documents and results from the testing, as well as recommendations with the system being launched or not.</p>

          <p>Game Development</p>
<p>Niagara College</p>
<p>3.0 GPA</p>
<p>In this program I learned how to develop a game, and not just from the programming side, but from also the artistical side of it, as well as docements potraying to the development of games. I however mostly focused on the programming side of it, learning how to do networking for games, AI for games and physics for games, just to name a few.</p>

<p>With this program, I had helped to develop two games with the course. The first one being a side-scroller developed by a group of 4, with me being the main programmer and assistant 3D modeller. But the main game I developed for was in the capstone project, in which I with a group of 6 others, had between 3 and 4 months to create a game from scratch, and showcase it to the public. We had two showcase, one for the college itself, and another at the Level Up Showcase in Toronto, where we competted against 80+ different teams from differenet post-secondary schools in Ontario. And in that, our game Balls To The Wall, came in the top 5.</p>
